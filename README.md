# Diabetes Decision Tree & Random Forest
The aim of this exercise is to predict whether a patient has diabetes using data from the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases using a decision tree classifier & random forest classifier

## Folders' content:
### Notebooks:
*   The main notebooks, with all the code, are in the src folder. 
*   The notebook 'Diabetes_Data-EDA' contains the exploratory data analysis. 
*   The notebook 'Diabetes_DecisTree' contains all the estimations and performance evaluation for the decision tree classifier. 
*   The notebook 'Diabetes_RandomForest' compares the performance, measureded by accuracy, of the latter optmised decision tree classifier with that of a random forest classifier.

### Other folders
*   Folder 'data/interim/' contains train and test X (covariates) data without handling missing values. 
*   Folder 'data/processed' X (covariates) train and test data, after replacing missing values, as well as test and train data for y (dependent variable)

*   Folder 'models' contains the stored models from the resulting analysis/estimations
