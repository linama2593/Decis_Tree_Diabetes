The main notebooks, with all the code, are in the src folder. The notebook 'Diabetes_Data-EDA' contains the exploratory data analysis. The notebook 'Diabetes_DecisTree' contains all the model estimations and performance evaluation

Folder data/interim/ contains train and test X (covariates) data without replacing missing values. Folder data/processed X (covariates) train and test data, after replacing missing values, as well as test and train data for y (dependent variable)

Folder models contains the resulting models from the analysis
